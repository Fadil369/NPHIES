# NPHIES - Unified Digital Healthcare Insurance Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a unified digital healthcare insurance platform aligned with NPHIES (National Platform for Health Information Exchange Services) and Saudi Vision 2030 goals. The platform modernizes healthcare insurance interactions across payers, providers, regulators, and citizens.

## Architecture

The platform is built on cloud-native, event-driven microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Core Services
- **API Gateway**: FHIR R4 compliant gateway with OAuth2/OIDC integration
- **Eligibility Service**: Real-time coverage validation with sub-900ms response time
- **Claims Service**: Comprehensive claims intake and adjudication
- **Prior Authorization Service**: Automated prior auth processing with ML
- **Terminology Service**: Healthcare code systems management
- **Fraud Detection**: AI-powered fraud prevention and detection

### Infrastructure
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka for reliable message processing
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL/CockroachDB + Redis + S3-compatible storage
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture with mTLS service mesh
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana stack

## Key Features

- üè• **FHIR R4 Compliance**: Full support for healthcare interoperability standards
- üîí **Security First**: Zero-trust architecture with end-to-end encryption
- üöÄ **High Performance**: <900ms eligibility checks, 300+ claims/sec throughput
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Machine learning for fraud detection and risk stratification
- üì± **Patient-Centric**: Digital wallet and mobile app for citizens
- üåê **Multi-Language**: Arabic and English support
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-based microservices architecture

## Performance Targets

- Eligibility API P99 latency: <900ms
- Prior auth auto-approval rate: 90% by Year 3
- Straight-through processing claims: 75% by Year 3
- Fraud detection precision: ‚â•0.8 by Year 3
- System availability: 99.95% SLA

## Compliance & Standards

- **Data Residency**: Saudi Arabia compliance
- **Privacy**: PDPL and HIPAA alignment
- **Standards**: FHIR R4, ICD-10-AM, ACHI, LOINC, SNOMED CT
- **Audit**: 10-year immutable audit trail
