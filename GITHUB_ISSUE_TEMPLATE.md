## Title

Implement Unified Digital Healthcare Insurance Platform - Phase 1 Core Infrastructure #github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent

## Description

### Overview

Implement the foundational infrastructure for a unified digital healthcare insurance platform aligned with NPHIES and Saudi Vision 2030 goals. This platform will modernize healthcare insurance interactions across payers, providers, regulators, and citizens.

### Business Objectives

- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate and standardize claims and prior authorization flows
- **Financial Integrity**: Detect and prevent fraud earlier in the lifecycle
- **Patient Empowerment**: Provide digital wallet, benefits clarity, pricing transparency
- **Regulatory Insight**: Enable near real-time national health economics analytics
- **Interoperability**: Enforce standards adoption (FHIR R4, ICD-10-AM, ACHI, LOINC, SNOMED CT)

### Key Performance Targets

- Eligibility API P99 latency: <900ms
- Prior auth auto-approval rate: 70% by Year 2, 90% by Year 3
- Average prior auth decision time: <60 seconds by Year 3
- Straight-through processing claims: 75% by Year 3
- Fraud detection precision: ≥0.8 by Year 3

### 2. Data Architecture

#### Database Layer

- [ ] PostgreSQL setup for transactional data
- [ ] Redis cluster for caching (eligibility, provider config)
- [ ] S3-compatible object storage for attachments
- [ ] Database migration framework

#### Core Data Models

- [ ] Member/Patient entity with coverage relationships
- [ ] Claim structure (header, line items, codes, attachments)
- [ ] Provider entity (organization, practitioner, facility)
- [ ] Code system and terminology mapping tables
- [ ] Audit trail schema

### 3. Security & Compliance Framework

#### Zero-Trust Security

- [ ] Service mesh setup (Istio or similar)
- [ ] mTLS configuration between services
- [ ] SPIFFE/SPIRE identity framework
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- [ ] Secrets management integration

#### Audit & Compliance

- [ ] Immutable audit logging system
- [ ] Data encryption at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- [ ] GDPR/PDPL compliance framework structure
- [ ] Audit trail retention policy (10 years)

### 4. Observability Stack

#### Monitoring & Tracing

- [ ] OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Grafana dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Jaeger for distributed tracing
- [ ] Log aggregation with structured logging

#### Health Checks & SLAs

- [ ] Service health check endpoints
- [ ] SLA monitoring (99.95% availability target)
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Alerting configuration

### 5. DevOps & Infrastructure

#### Kubernetes Deployment

- [ ] Helm charts for all services
- [ ] Namespace organization (core, data, ml, integration, security)
- [ ] Resource quotas and limits
- [ ] Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

#### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Docker container builds
- [ ] Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- [ ] GitOps deployment with ArgoCD

#### Integration Adapters

- [ ] HL7 v2 to FHIR translation framework
- [ ] Legacy system adapter templates
- [ ] Provider onboarding toolkit
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Principles

- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-based microservices
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka as communication backbone
- **API-First**: FHIR R4 compliance with REST/GraphQL
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust with end-to-end encryption
- **Multi-Language**: Arabic (primary) and English support

### Performance Requirements

- **Scalability**: 300 claims/sec sustained throughput
- **Availability**: 99.95% SLA for core services
- **Latency**: <1 second P99 for real-time operations
- **Disaster Recovery**: RPO ≤5 min, RTO ≤30 min

### Technology Stack

- **API Gateway**: Kong or Nginx with FHIR support
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Container Platform**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana
- **IaC**: Terraform + Helm

## Success Criteria

- [ ] FHIR compliance score ≥70%
- [ ] Eligibility service baseline latency <900ms
- [ ] Successfully process test claims end-to-end
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Complete audit trail for all transactions
- [ ] Integration with 3 mock provider systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach

1. Start with minimal viable services and expand iteratively
2. Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing
3. Follow GitOps practices with infrastructure as code
4. Document all APIs with OpenAPI specifications
5. Create monitoring and alerting for all services

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow BrainSAIT coding standards
- Use appropriate language for each service (Go/Java for backend, React for frontend)
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write detailed API documentation
- Include health check endpoints for all services

### Security Requirements

- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Implement defense-in-depth security model
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Encrypt all sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Performance**: Conduct load testing early and regularly
- **Security**: Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Data Quality**: Create validation pipelines with error handling
- **Integration**: Build robust adapters for legacy systems
- **Compliance**: Design with privacy and audit requirements from start

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Once core infrastructure is complete, Phase 2 will add:

- Prior Authorization Engine with ML capabilities
- Advanced Claims Adjudication with business rules
- Fraud Detection System with AI models
- Patient Mobile Application
- Payment Orchestration system
