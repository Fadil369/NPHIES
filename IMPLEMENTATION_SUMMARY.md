- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via Kafka
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful error handling and circuit breaker patterns

### FHIR R4 Compliance
- **Resource Models**: Complete FHIR resource implementations
- **Validation**: FHIR-compliant validation and error handling
- **Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for FHIR resources
- **Bundle Support**: Search results with proper pagination

### Performance Features
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching with Redis
- **Response Time Optimization**: <900ms P99 target for eligibility checks
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and health checks

## 📊 Key Metrics & SLAs

### Performance Targets
- **Eligibility API**: <900ms P99 latency (implemented and optimized)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 85%+ for frequently accessed data
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime target with health checks
- **Throughput**: 300+ claims/sec sustained processing capability

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with configurable expiration
- **Audit Trail**: 100% audit coverage for all operations
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based authorization with scopes

## 🔧 Development & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Start infrastructure
make dev-up

# Build all services
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Check health
make health-check
```

### Service Endpoints
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Eligibility Service**: http://localhost:8090
- **Health Checks**: /health and /ready on each service
- **Metrics**: /metrics on each service
